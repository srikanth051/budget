# Financial Goal Tracker App (Interview Task)

## Overview

Welcome to the Financial Goal Tracker App, a Flutter application designed as part of a job interview task. The app aims to demonstrate foundational features for managing and tracking financial goals. Please note that the project is currently a work in progress, and certain features are yet to be fully implemented.

## Features (In Progress)

1. **Goal Progress Visualization:**
   - A visual representation (e.g., circular progress bar) of the user's progress towards their financial goal.

2. **Goal Details:**
   - Detailed information about the financial goal, including total amount saved, target amount, and expected completion date.
   - Proactive suggestions on how users can accelerate goal achievement based on their current progress.

3. **Contribution History:**
   - A comprehensive list of recent contributions towards the goal, displaying dates and contribution amounts.

## Firebase Firestore Integration

The app aims to utilize Firebase Firestore for seamless data synchronization. Firestore is a NoSQL cloud database, ensuring real-time updates and efficient data retrieval.

### Firebase Setup (Yet to be Completed)

1. **Create a Firebase Project:**
   - Visit the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.

2. **Set Up Firestore Database:**
   - Configure Firestore in the Firebase Console, creating collections for financial goals and contributions.

3. **Obtain Configuration Files:**
   - Download the necessary configuration files (google-services.json for Android, GoogleService-Info.plist for iOS) from the Firebase Console.

4. **Configure Firebase in Flutter Project:**
   - Add the required dependencies in the `pubspec.yaml` file.
   - Initialize Firebase in the `main.dart` file.

5. **Run the Application:**
   - Execute the `flutter run` command to start the app.

## Getting Started (Partially Implemented)

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/srikanth051/budget.git
